# Image Classifier 

Welcome to the Image Classifier project! This project is part of a Udacity nanodegree program and focuses on leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the 102 Oxford Flower dataset. Our goal is to develop a robust image classifier capable of identifying diverse flower species.


## Project Overview

The 102 Oxford Flower dataset is a rich collection of floral images, each representing a different species. Our project harnesses the capabilities of CNNs to process and analyze these images, learning to recognize distinctive features and patterns that define each flower species.

## Key Objectives

Our project encompasses the following key objectives:

- **Data Preprocessing:** We carefully preprocess the dataset, including resizing, augmentation, and normalization, to ensure it is compatible with our CNN model.

- **CNN Model Implementation:** We build and train a Convolutional Neural Network capable of classifying flower images into their respective species.

- **Model Evaluation:** We assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure it can accurately classify images.

- **Inference:** Our trained model can be used for inference, making predictions on new flower images.

- **Documentation:** We provide comprehensive documentation to guide users through the project, understand the code, and reproduce results.

## Usage

You can interact with this project in the following ways:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MischaRauch/ImageClassifier.git
   ```

2. **Data Exploration:** Dive into the dataset by running Jupyter notebooks or scripts in the `notebooks` directory to explore and understand the data.

3. **Model Training:** Explore our CNN model implementation in the `models` directory, and experiment with training the model on your own datasets.

4. **Inference:** Use the trained model to make predictions on your own flower images.

5. **Contribute:** This project welcomes contributions, whether in the form of code enhancements, bug fixes, or insights on improving the model's performance.
